# A note on Hypixel and this mod

On the 19th of August, Hypixel updated their rules which made this mod disallowed. 
They blocked this mod (and every other perspective mod's) modid,
meaning you will be kicked if you attempt to join with it. However as of recent,
this version of Perspective Mod has been unblacklisted. Regardless I strongly discourage creating or using
versions of this mod or any other mod to bypass blacklists on any server.
